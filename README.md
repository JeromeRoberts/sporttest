## SilverStripe 4 Project for DNA

## Notes/Comments ##
- I've just included the .env file and a .sql file with players, colours, teams (sporttest_2021-04-18.sql) in repo in root directory
- Rugby and Cricket teams can be added from within the Teams ModelAdmin tab. Colours can also be added here.
- Sportsmen can be added and assigned teams from the Sportsmen ModelAdmin tab.
- The functions were just written within HomePage page type as two methods. They are called via the homepage template.
- Kept the project prettly lightweight as have only really had time on Friday to do this.. Definetly improvements i'd make if I had more time. Mostly around the CMS usability
